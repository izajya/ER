This was a paired project with my classmate. This is an application 
that would be used in emergency rooms by doctors and nurses. There 
is a part of the application where a nurse would enter a patientâ€™s 
information such as name, sex, age, etc. This patient will be added 
to the list of patients that need to be seen. As the list of patients 
grows, this application determines which patient the doctor should 
treat next by prioritizing patients with more serious injuries over 
patients with smaller injuries. This can increase efficiency and create 
order within the emergency room.
